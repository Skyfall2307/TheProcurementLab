      <h2>Generative AI</h2>
      <p><strong>Gen AI is not just another tool.</strong> While traditional AI focused on automating rules-based tasks, Gen AI brings creativity, contextual understanding, and dynamic learning into the mix.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Automated sourcing and supplier discovery:</strong> Analyzes thousands of suppliers globally, extracts key data, and generates RFPs rapidly.</li>
        <li><strong>Intelligent contract generation and review:</strong> Drafts contracts, flags risks, and negotiates clauses using context and history.</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive spend analysis and forecasting:</strong> Forecasts demand, detects anomalies, and suggests proactive actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Natural language interfaces:</strong> Tools like ChatGPT enable intuitive access to insights and data through conversation.</li>
      </ul>
