      <h1>What is Process Mining in S2P?</h1>
      <p><em>31st of March 2025 • By Katarzyna Fonteyn</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
      <p>I was familiar with the benefits of process mining across different business processes, but it wasn’t until about a year ago that I truly deep-dived into its value for <strong>Source-to-Pay (S2P)</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Process mining</strong> uses real event logs from S2P systems to reconstruct and visualize how processes actually run—not just how they’re documented. This creates <strong>true end-to-end transparency</strong> across the entire S2P cycle.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
      <h2>Where It Helps in the S2P Lifecycle</h2>
      <p>Process mining doesn’t just give high-level insights — it dives deep into every step of the S2P process, revealing where <strong>bottlenecks</strong>, non-compliance, and value leakage occur.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
      <h2>1. Sourcing</h2>
      <p><strong>Common challenges:</strong> Lack of visibility into cycle times, RFx management, or delays in contract creation.</p>
      <p><strong>How process mining helps:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Analyzes duration of sourcing events (RFx to contract)</li>
        <li>Highlights delays and variations by category, buyer, or region</li>
        <li>Detects skipped or out-of-sequence steps</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
      <h2>2. Procure-to-Order</h2>
      <p><strong>Common challenges:</strong> Maverick buying, slow approvals, and order errors.</p>
      <p><strong>How process mining helps:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identifies POs created after invoices or not linked to contracts</li>
        <li>Detects long cycle times in PO creation and approval flows</li>
        <li>Uncovers repetitive manual tasks and unnecessary rework</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
      <h2>3. Invoice-to-Pay</h2>
      <p><strong>Common challenges:</strong> Late payments, duplicate invoices, missed early payment discounts.</p>
      <p><strong>How process mining helps:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tracks full invoice lifecycle (receipt to payment)</li>
        <li>Flags blocked invoices and manual intervention causes</li>
        <li>Analyzes payment behavior and its financial impact</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
      <h2>Key Business Benefits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Reveals true process flows across systems, regions, and teams</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Identifies policy violations like PO splitting or off-contract spend</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Reduces sourcing and payment cycles, increases automation</li>
        <li><strong>Cost savings:</strong> Avoids late fees, captures early discounts, reduces manual effort</li>
        <li><strong>Performance improvement:</strong> Benchmarks KPIs like touchless invoice rate and PO compliance</li>
        <li><strong>Root cause analysis:</strong> Uses AI to understand not just what happened, but why—and how to fix it</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-card">
      <p><strong>Process mining</strong> transforms S2P into a living, breathing system you can monitor, diagnose, and continuously improve.</p>
      <p>It empowers Procurement, Finance, and Shared Services teams to <strong>work smarter—with data, not guesswork</strong>.</p>
